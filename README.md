# README

This meant to be a collection of good holdout spots for Killing Floor 1 multiplayer matches on "Hell on Earth" difficulty. I only uploaded it to GitHub for the following reasons:

- Markdown is a convenient way to combine images, their titles and description.
- GitHub is a convenient and free way to share Markdown files.
- The collection of images is huge, and viewing it on GitHub is (in my opinion) much more convenient than listing dozens of Imgur links.

# ATTENTION

This collection has only been uploaded for demonstration purposes. It may be deleted at any moment.

Thank you for your understanding.
